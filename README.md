# Chrome-Extention-Inject
A chrome extention that will automatically inject JavaScript code in a Jotform I get from the school to fill out my timesheet every week (NOT ANYMORE).
Every personal information is commented out and replaced with "####" .This script is hard-coded, it's flexible only to the degree I need it to be.
Its intended to run only in my specific Jotform. It will not work in other forms.
